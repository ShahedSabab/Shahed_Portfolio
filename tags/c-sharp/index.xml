      <description>The objective of this project is to develop a system for physically impaired people who do not have a pair of working hands. The system provides different functionalities to the users: navigate computers using head movements, eye blink for clicking, different head gestures to read documents, and watch multimedia. The system is developed using C#. The head movement is tracked using EmguCV (OpenCV wrapper) and some heuristic calculations. Blink detection is performed using haarcascade of eyes.</description>

      <description>A system to replace the traditional mouse and keyboard that only uses hand gestures to control computers. This system focuses on navigating computers, reading documents and controlling multimedia like videos, pictures. This multimodal system uses a leap motion device and a webcam to capture hand movements and different gestures.
 Real-time tracking of hand movement. (haarcascade, Viola-Jones)  Implements the Kalman filter for smoothing.  Captures hand gesture with leap motion device.</description>

      <title>Pointer Security: A security system for computers - C#</title>

      <description>A security system for computers which runs as the background process and tracks keyboard or mouse inputs. Any unauthorized input triggers this system and sends a notification to the userâ€™s phone through text messages (GSM). Users can use a mobile app (named Pointer Security) to see the live webcam feed, screen streaming and check who is using the computer and can send commands remotely through the app to either shut down or lock the computer.</description>
