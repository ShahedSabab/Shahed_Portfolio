      <description>List of Apps   The objective of this project is sentiment analysis (i.e., Positive, Neutral, Negative) from the popular health and fitness app reviews. For this task, app reviews are collected from the google play store. 10 popular health and fitness apps are chosen. All around 12000 most recent reviews are collected. Ratings are considered as the measure/label of positive, negative, and neutral sentiment of the reviews. The collected data are preprocessed and trained using a transformer model.</description>

      <description>The objective of this project is to classify news category from articles. The input data consist of 2225 news articles from the BBC news website corresponding to stories in 5 topical areas (e.g., business, entertainment, politics, sport, tech). LSTM has been applied in the classification task to categorize articles.  TensorFlow 2.0 has been used to train the model. Word embedding is used in feature generation. TSNE is used to visualize the word vectors in 2d space.</description>

      <description>The dataset includes tweets about disasters, e.g., earthquake, wildfire. The objective is to detect if the tweet is about a real disaster vs. fake disaster. Different approaches have been performed for data cleaning and training the model. The best model can predict real vs. fake tweets with 89% accuracy using transfer learning (BERT).
The following models have been developed for training: BOW Model with Logistic Regression. (accuracy 77%) Tf-Idf with Logistic Regression.</description>

      <title>Intent Detection - BERT</title>

      <guid>https://shahedsabab.github.io/shahed_portfolio/post/project-intent/</guid>
      <description>The objective of this project is to detect intent from texts. For this, a benchmark dataset is used, which includes 7 intents (Search Creative Work, get weather, Book Restaurant, Play Music, Add to Playlist, Rate Book, Search Screening Event) and 14 thousand samples. Transfer learning has been leveraged to train a machine learning model. The model takes the raw texts, which are tokenized and vectorized to feed into the pre-trained model.</description>
